# Gatsby Blog Publisher

This is a script that allows me automate the publishing process for my blog posts.

It works by allowing me to write blog posts in the root/WIP directory of a gatsbyJS project. When ready to publish, I can run this script to: 

- rename the file to index.md
- move the file to the appropriate folder
- rename the folder to the original document name for GatsbyJS to generate routes

# Requirements

- GatsbyJS project installed
- GatsbyJS_Project_Root/content/blog **as an existing directory**
- GatsbyJS_Project_Root/WIP **as the directory to write your work in progress posts**

# Installation

Two methods:
1. Add the script as a source:
2. Download and run the script when needed
